One of the pain point in huly.io / huly.app is that currently there is no feature to export all of the issue in the task tracker. Andyou gotta do it manually

So I provide a browser extension to do just that.

- You need to view the issues in list version
- After all selection is done, you need to manually export by right clicking first issue and select export
